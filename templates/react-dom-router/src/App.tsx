      <h1>Basic Example</h1>

      <p>
        This example demonstrates some of the core features of React Router
        including nested <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s,{" "}
        <code>&lt;Outlet&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s, and using a
        "*" route (aka "splat route") to render a "not found" page when someone
        visits an unrecognized URL.
      </p>

      {/* Routes nest inside one another. Nested route paths build upon
            parent route paths, and nested route elements render inside
            parent route elements. See the note about <Outlet> below. */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />

          {/* Using path="*"" means "match anything", so this route
                acts like a catch-all for URLs that we don't have explicit
                routes for. */}
          <Route path="*" element={<NoMatch />} />
